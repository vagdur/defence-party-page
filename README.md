# Party Registration & Social Network Management System

I used AI to write nearly the entire thing, and so of course I let it also write most of the README:

A comprehensive event registration and social network analysis platform built for managing party registrations while tracking and analyzing social connections between attendees. This system combines traditional event management with advanced social network mapping to optimize seating arrangements and enhance guest experiences.

## Getting Started

It should be possible to get this set up by just cloning the repository, and then creating a new worker in Cloudflare based on that repository. I have never tried that, though, so some finagling of details may be needed. I offer no support in this, consult your nearest ChatGPT for help with this process.
